As a user, I want to be able to filter my playlists by any music information that I choose. This could be key, tempo, artist, genre, etc.\n\n4. As a user, I want to be able to see what the most popular songs are on the platform or discover new music that may be trending at the moment, so I can learn more about new music and keep up with popular music trends to keep my audience entertained.\n\n5. As a user, I want to be able to update my playlists with song/genre recommendations from different playlists on the platform, or create a brand new playlist altogether using these recommendations.\n",
